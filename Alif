The world is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities in the 21st century. The rapid changes in technology, economy, society, and environment require new ways of thinking and acting. The old models of leadership, based on hierarchy, authority, and control, are no longer effective or relevant. The world needs leaders who can envision, create, and sustain positive change for the common good. These leaders are called Visioner of Liberation.

Visioner of Liberation is a term coined by Dedy Hermanto, Hasan Hariri, and Ridwan, the authors of a book supplement on visionary leadership. They define Visioner of Liberation as "a leader who has a clear and compelling vision of the future, who can communicate it effectively to others, who can mobilize resources and people to realize it, and who can liberate themselves and others from the constraints and obstacles that hinder the achievement of the vision".

Visioner of Liberation is not a position or a title, but a mindset and a behavior. Anyone can be a Visioner of Liberation, regardless of their role, status, or background. Visioner of Liberation is not limited to a specific field or sector, but can be applied to any domain or context. Visioner of Liberation is not a fixed or static concept, but a dynamic and evolving one, that adapts to the changing needs and circumstances of the world.

Visioner of Liberation has four main characteristics: vision, communication, mobilization, and liberation. 

- Vision: Visioner of Liberation has a clear and compelling vision of the future, that is based on their values, beliefs, and aspirations. The vision is not a mere fantasy or wishful thinking, but a realistic and attainable goal, that is aligned with the needs and interests of the stakeholders. The vision is not a personal or selfish agenda, but a shared and collective purpose, that is beneficial for the common good. The vision is not a rigid or fixed plan, but a flexible and adaptable strategy, that is open to feedback and improvement.
- Communication: Visioner of Liberation can communicate their vision effectively to others, using various methods and media. The communication is not a one-way or top-down process, but a two-way or bottom-up dialogue, that involves listening, understanding, and respecting the views and opinions of others. The communication is not a monotonous or boring presentation, but a lively and engaging story, that uses emotions, images, and metaphors to capture the attention and imagination of others. The communication is not a manipulative or coercive persuasion, but a genuine and sincere invitation, that inspires and motivates others to join the vision.
- Mobilization: Visioner of Liberation can mobilize resources and people to realize their vision, using various skills and tools. The mobilization is not a solitary or individual effort, but a collaborative and collective action, that leverages the strengths and talents of others. The mobilization is not a hierarchical or authoritarian command, but a participatory and democratic leadership, that empowers and enables others to take initiative and responsibility. The mobilization is not a mechanical or routine operation, but a creative and innovative solution, that seeks new and better ways to overcome the challenges and seize the opportunities.
- Liberation: Visioner of Liberation can liberate themselves and others from the constraints and obstacles that hinder the achievement of the vision, using various strategies and techniques. The liberation is not a passive or reactive response, but a proactive and active intervention, that anticipates and prevents the potential problems and risks. The liberation is not a negative or destructive action, but a positive and constructive one, that removes the barriers and creates the conditions for the vision to flourish. The liberation is not a temporary or superficial change, but a permanent and profound one, that transforms the mindsets and behaviors of themselves and others.

Visioner of Liberation is a new paradigm of leadership in the 21st century, that can help the world to cope with the complex and uncertain situations, and to create a better and brighter future for all. Visioner of Liberation is not a rare or exceptional phenomenon, but a common and achievable one, that can be learned and practiced by anyone who has the passion and the courage to make a difference. Visioner of Liberation is not a distant or abstract idea, but a close and concrete reality, that can be seen and experienced in the lives and works of many leaders in various fields and sectors.

Some examples of Visioner of Liberation are:

- Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, who had a vision of a free and democratic nation, who communicated it through his speeches and writings, who mobilized millions of people to fight against apartheid, and who liberated himself and his country from the oppression and injustice.
- Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, who had a vision of a personal and innovative technology, who communicated it through his products and presentations, who mobilized thousands of employees and partners to create and market them, and who liberated himself and his customers from the limitations and conventions of the industry.
- Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who had a vision of a universal and quality education, who communicated it through her activism and advocacy, who mobilized hundreds of organizations and supporters to campaign and fundraise for it, and who liberated herself and her peers from the violence and discrimination.
